# Features 

the bot has 4 main features:

    Leave a comment under the last published post in the profile that the
    bot is visiting
  - Auto follow:
    Leave the follow to the profile that the bot is visiting
  - Auto unfollow:
    stops following one of the people at who previously it left the follow
  - Auto like:
    if the profile that the bot is visiting has more than 3 posts, leave 3 
    like, otherwise leave as many likes as there are posts
    
you can select the ones you want from the bot's Gui.

# For the correct functioning of the bot
  - Do not have interactions with the bot (it is preferable to open it in a new desktop and let it work).
  - The mouse pointer if positioned on the firefox page opened by the bot could cause, in some phases, some interference and therefore the bot malfunction.
  - Disable instagram two-step authentication.
  - Have a stable connection (failure to connect to the internet causes the bot to lock)

# In case of errors
-  the bot should create an error.txt file, send it to me.
If it crashes and doesn't create the file describe me the problem.
